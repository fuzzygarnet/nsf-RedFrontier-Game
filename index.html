Mars is the next big frontier, and two rival companies have set up shop on the Red Planet. Their colonies are just getting started, with a handful of scientists, some food, water, medical supplies, and a stash of resources they've already mined. The goal? To turn these basic outposts into thriving, self-sufficient colonies that can support everyday people. To get there, they'll need to mine resources, research groundbreaking technologies, and build all the facilities a growing colony needs. But it’s not all cutthroat competition—this is a friendly race. The companies can trade resources to give each other a hand when needed. In the end, the first to create a fully self-sustaining colony wins the ultimate cash prize—and the bragging rights to go with it. Let the race to colonize Mars begin!</p><button id="startGameButton" class="modal-button">OK</button></div></div><div id="researchCountdown" style="display:none;position:absolute;top:570px;right:40px;font-size:15px;color:#fff;font-family:'Courier New',Courier,monospace">No tech is currently being researched.</div><div id="baseMenuModal" class="modal"><div class="modal-content"><h2>Base Menu</h2><button onclick="openTradeModal()" class="modal-button">Trade</button> <button onclick="openPurchaseModal()" class="modal-button">Purchase</button> <button onclick='closeModal("baseMenuModal")' class="modal-button">Close</button></div></div><div id="purchaseModal" class="modal"><div class="modal-content"><h2>Purchase Menu</h2><div id="purchaseCost"></div><button onclick='closeModal("purchaseModal")' class="modal-button">Cancel</button></div></div><div id="tradeModal" class="modal"><div class="modal-content"><h2>Trade Menu</h2><p>Specify the resources you want to give and receive.</p><table class="trade-table"><tr><th></th><th>Giving</th><th>Requesting</th></tr><tr><td><label for="tradeWaterGiveInput">Water:</label></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeWaterGiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeWaterReceiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td></tr><tr><td><label for="tradeRegolithGiveInput">Regolith:</label></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeRegolithGiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeRegolithReceiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td></tr><tr><td><label for="tradeBasaltGiveInput">Basalt:</label></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeBasaltGiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeBasaltReceiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td></tr><tr><td><label for="tradeSulfurGiveInput">Sulfur:</label></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeSulfurGiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td><td><input type="number" id="tradeSulfurReceiveInput" min="0" value="0"></td></tr></table><button onclick="proposeTrade()" class="modal-button">Propose</button> <button onclick="cancelTrade()" class="modal-button">Cancel</button></div></div><div id="tradeResponseModal" class="modal"><div class="modal-content"><h2 id="tradeResponseHeader"></h2><p id="tradeResponseDetails"></p><button onclick="acceptTrade()" class="modal-button">Accept</button> <button onclick="declineTrade()" class="modal-button">Decline</button></div></div><div id="instructionModal" class="modal"><div class="modal-content"><h2 style="text-align:center">Instructions</h2><p style="text-align:center"></p><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Objective:</b></span> <span>The goal of the game is to be the first to grow your colony’s population to 500.</span></li><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Starting Units:</b></span> <span>You begin with one miner unit on the surface of Mars.</span></li><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Actions per Turn:</b></span> <span>Each turn, you can either: - Move your miner unit to an adjacent tile, or - Mine a tile for resources.</span></li><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Resource Mining:</b></span> <span>When you mine a tile, you will receive a random amount of the following resources: - Water, - Sulfur, - Basalt, - Regolith.</span></li><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Using Resources:</b></span> <span>Use the resources you gather to: - Purchase more miner units, - Construct buildings that will help your colony grow, - Trade with your opponent to acquire the resources you need.</span></li><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Colony Management:</b></span> <span>To purchase new units or buildings, click on your base colony to open the managbent menu.</span></li><li><span style="color:#007bff"><b>Ending Your Turn:</b></span> <span>To end your turn, you must take action with all the miner units currently on the board.
